 	<p>Jethro Vega Tatco a good-looking and a wise young adult in his twenties<sup>1</sup>. Born in the 18th day of October, 2000 in the city of Pasig, Jethro was known to be the naughtiest among the four (4) children of Analiza and Michael Tatco, which is why if you can see he really has a lot of scars; 
		some of it visible on his face<sup>2</sup>. As a child, Jethro was fond of playing outside<sup>3</sup>. He is very social and gained a lot of friends<sup>4</sup>. Expectedly, those friends of him are still his friends up to this date<sup>5</sup>. 
		He had all the things that children want back then; bike, PSP, Gameboy, a personal computer, you name it<sup>6</sup>. He was a very protective brother to his younger sisters, which is very understandable<sup>7</sup>. 
		Jethro grew up without his older brother by his side, so when he finally did, it was a long ride of quarrel and fist fights<sup>8</sup>. They fortunately get passed that and became the best of friends<sup>9</sup>.
		<br><br><br>
		His parents were very caring, yet they let him learn how to be independent by letting him discover new things all by himself<sup>10</sup>. In fact, Jethro is very active in his extracurricular activities, end really excel on them<sup>11</sup>. He was a part of his elementary school's Boy Scout organization<sup>12</sup>. 
		He shared how they went camping in Mount Makiling, Mount Capinpin, Baguio and even inside the school<sup>13</sup>. 
		That is where he learned how to be strategic<sup>14</sup>. They were taught how to lit fire with sticks and stones and cook chicken with it<sup>15</sup>. He also experienced competing with other schools in a tug of war, where his team expectedly won<sup>16</sup>. 
		He remained friends with those people he met on the campings he went<sup>17</sup>. Jethro also joined their elementary school's Dance Troupe, which focuses on Traditional Dances<sup>18</sup>. 
		<br><br><br>
		He also joined basketball leagues within their barangay and of course, he found new friends and even enemies who envy how he plays<sup>19</sup>. He loved playing basketball ever since<sup>20</sup>. His uncle taught him how to play it, and ever since, he enjoyed it so much, he dreamt of being a varsity player<sup>21</sup>.

	<div align = "justify">
	<p> In my teenage years, his life revolves around that dream as well<sup>1</sup>. He was transferred to a private school with his brother<sup>2</sup>.
		Unfortunately, he was bullied before for being a transferee<sup>3</sup>. Yet, it was not for too long when he met new friends who have the same interest as he did<sup>4</sup>. 
		They told him to join fraternities so he cannot be bullied, and someone will have his back<sup>5</sup>. 
		From being the bullied transferee, Jethro quickly became famous for beating the well-known bully in their school on a fist fight<sup>6</sup>. 
		
		<br><br><br>But his teenage life did not revolve here.6 He pursued his passion in sports played for their school and compete<sup>7</sup>. He even joined their volleyball team, and won a lot of competitions as well<sup>8</sup>. 
		This athletic journey of his did not stop when he moved on to Senior High, where he studied in University of the East<sup>9</sup>. He was a student of Accounting and Business Management<sup>10</sup>. 
		They have a workload of tasks, but that did not stop him from playing<sup>11</sup>. In fact, his passion grew more<sup>12</sup>. One of his coaches back in Grade 7 admired how he play, and recommended him to play in Lyceum of the Philippines University<sup>13</sup>. 
		He went for a try-out, and got in<sup>14</sup>. Unfortunately, after that day, he was injured after playing another game, and he was diagnosed with Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL)<sup>15</sup>. ACL is a common injury for athletes, and its treatment is very expensive<sup>16</sup>.
		His family did not have the money to get him treated, and that is when all his dream of being a varsity player shambles<sup>17</sup>. As soon as he knew that, he know he cannot play again<sup>18</sup>.
		He needed to rest his body for a long time, because one abuse of himself might get him into a deeper injury<sup>19</sup>. It was unfortunate, but he have no other choice but to accept it<sup>20</sup>. </p></div>

	<h2 id="college"><u>College Years</u></h2>
	<div align = "justify">
	<p>From wanting to be an Architecture, Business Manager, and a varsity player, Jethro resorted into pursuing IT<sup>1</sup>.
		It was a stressful journey for him, because he did not have any knowledge at all about this course<sup>2</sup>. 
		He only chose it because his father recommended it<sup>3</sup>. 
		Still, he is trying his best to keep up with all the lessons<sup>4</sup>. 
		However, now he is in college, he always wonders how things would be different if he didn't get injured<sup>5</sup>. 
		He did not feel all blues, though<sup>6</sup>.
		He is still grateful that he gained friends in his college years that helped him in every task he cannot do all by himself<sup>7</sup>. His professors are also very helpful and understanding, ready to answer all the questions, and ready to explain everything that he did not understand<sup>8</sup>. 
		Maybe, God really have other plans for him<sup>9</sup>.
		<br><br><br>
		What's bad is his eyesight<sup>10</sup>. Spending all day in computer, may it be for leisure or academics, really worsen his eyesight<sup>11</sup>. 
		He cannot go outside and play because it hurts his knees, and there's really no other option for him but to play whenever he's stressed or sad<sup>12</sup>. 
		Sometimes, he will hold a ball, dribble it and shoot it on the wall<sup>13</sup>. 
		He did not need to run, jump or anything he just wanted to feel the ball on his hands<sup>14</sup>. 
		It was really unfortunate, but who knows where this man might go?<sup>15</sup>. He is a brave man, and he can conquer any problems he will face<sup>16</sup>.
		He always had a strong heart, and that is one of his traits that is very admirable<sup>17</sup>. 
		Yet, having a strong heart does not always necessarily mean that he is strong all the time he cries, gets mad, and sometimes take a step back when he know that he cannot handle everything<sup>18</sup>.
		He believes that with the right people to support you and right motivation to move on, he will be destined in the right place<sup>19</sup>. 
		Jethro is an inspiring man, and every tear he shed now, will water his plants for tomorrow<sup>20</sup>.</p></div>
